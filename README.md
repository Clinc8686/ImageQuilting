# ImageQuilting
A project at Trier University of Applied Sciences to develop an algorithm for image quilting. 

Runs with Java 15.0 or higher.


# Instructions
1. Start the ImageQuilting.jar file by double-clicking it or using the command line.
2. The following window titled "Image Quilting" will open:
3. Click the "Choose input" button.
4. The following window titled "Open" will appear:
5. In the "Open" window, navigate to an image (png/jpg) of your choice. Make sure your selected image does not exceed a size of 400x400 pixels, or it won't be displayed.
6. Select the file and click the lower right "Open" button.
7. The "Open" window should close, and in the "Image Quilting" window, you will see your chosen image in the middle field labeled "Input." In the right field labeled "Options," you will see additional options: Clear, patch size, end image size, overlap size.
8. You can adjust the following settings using sliders and buttons:
• Patch size: The size of the starting patch and all patches that will be compared, as well as the size at which the final image will be filled (in pixels).\
• End image size: The size of the final image (in pixels).\
• Overlap size: The size of the border used for comparing patch edges (in pixels).\
• Clear: The clear button. It will erase the contents of the Output, Input, and any text in the Info panel, except for the input image in the Input field.\
• Choose Input: The "Open" window will reappear, allowing you to select a different input image.\
Note: The range of values for the sliders is predefined and cannot be changed.

9. The Info panel will display hints if something doesn't work or if you've selected incorrect values for the sliders.
10. You can start the quilting process by clicking the "Start image quilting" button. Depending on the image size and your parameter choices, this may take from a few seconds to several minutes.
11. Experiment with different textures and different parameter settings!
12. If any of the Output or Input fields become full, click the "Clear" button.
